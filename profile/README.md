## What We Do

The first AI-native test automation company.

What takes days now takes hours. 10x your QA velocity.

We deliver the framework, tests for your critical workflows, and training for your team.
You own it all.

**The difference:** 
AI generates the code. Our architecture keeps it scalable, maintainable, and production-grade.
*Traditional: 1-2 days. Isagawa: ~30-60 minutes for standard workflows.*
